# Contributing to Idris-Dev

The Idris Community welcomes pull requests, bug reporting, and bug squashing!
However, we cannot do it all ourself, and want to make it as easy as possible to contribute changes to get things working.
Here are a few guidelines that we would like contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you are familiar with [Git](http://git-scm.com/book).
1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
1. Make sure you are familiar with: [Idris](http://eb.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/writings/idris-tutorial.pdf).
1. Make sure you can install `Idris`:
  * [Mac OS X](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Idris-on-OS-X-using-Homebrew)
  * [Ubuntu](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Idris-on-Ubuntu)
  * [Debian](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Idris-on-Debian)
  * [Windows](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Idris-on-Windows)

## Issue Reporting

Before you report an issue, or wish to add cool functionality please try and check to see if there are existing [issues](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/pulls).
We do not want you wasting your time, duplicating somebody's work!

## The Campsite Rule

A basic rule when contributing to Idris is the **campsite rule**: leave the codebase in better condition than you found it.
Please clean up any messes that you find, and don't leave behind new messes for the next contributor.

## Contributing to the default libraries.

`Idris` ships with a set of packages in `libs/` that is provided as a default library.
These packages should not be seen as the *standard* as when working with dependent types we do not necessarily know how best to work with dependent types.
These packages offer functionality that can be built on top of when constructing `Idris` programs.

One major point to make is that everything in prelude will be imported automatically, unless given
the `--noprelude` option.
A central idea within the `Idris` Community is that what counts as `Idris` is: **the compiler plus the Standard Prelude**.
Other libraries (base, effects, etc) are still part of the distribution, but not necessarily standard.

As `Idris` is still being developed we are open to suggestions and changes that make improvements to these default packages.
Major changes to the library (or `Idris` itself) should ideally be discussed first through the projects official channels of communication i.e. the mailing list, github wiki, or IRC, or as a [Dragon Egg](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Feature-proposals).
Developers then seeking to add content to `Idris`s prelude and default library, should do so through a PR where more discussion's and refinements can be made.

We do not want you wasting your time nor duplicating somebody's work!

Of note: developers should be prepared to wait until their PR has been discussed and authorized prior to the PRs inclusion.

## Making Changes

Idris developers and hackers try to adhere to something similar to the [successful git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
The steps are straightforward.

### New contributors

For those new to the project:

1. Fork our [main development repository](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev) `idris-dev` on github e.g.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:

```
$ git clone git@github.com/<your github user name>/Idris-dev.git
```

3. Add `idris-lang/Idris-dev` as a remote upstream

```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:idris-lang/Idris-dev.git
```

### Existing Contributors

For those already contributing to the project:

1. Ensure your existing clone is up-to-date with current `HEAD` e.g.

```
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```

### Remaining Steps

The remaining steps are the same for both new and existing contributors:

1. Create, and checkout onto, a topic branch on which to base you work.
  * This is typically the master branch.
  * For your own sanity, please avoid working on the `master` branch.

```
$ git branch fix/master/my_contrib master
$ git checkout fix/master/my_contrib
```

1. Make commits of logical units.
1. Check for unnecessary whitespace with

```
$ git diff --check
```

1. Make sure your commit messages are along the lines of:

        Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

        More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
        characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
        subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
        line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
        the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
        two together.

        Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

        - Bullet points are okay, too

        - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
          single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

1. Make sure you have added any necessary tests for your changes.
1. Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

```
$ make test
```

1. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.

```
$ git push origin fix/master/my_contrib
```

1. Go to GitHub and submit a pull request to `idris-dev`

From there you will have to wait on one of the `idris-dev` committers to respond to the request.
This response might be an accept or some changes/improvements/alternatives will be suggest.
We do not guarantee that all requests will be accepted.

## Increases chances of acceptance.

To help increase the chance of your pull request being accepted:

1. Run the tests.
1. Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides, whatever is affected by your contribution
1. Use appropriate code formatting for both `Idris` and `Haskell`.
